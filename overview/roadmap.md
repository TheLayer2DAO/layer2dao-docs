Through strategic incubation and acceleration, we aim to participate in several projects per year and route a token allocation from these projects directly back into the DAO. On top of receiving token supply, the treasury will also be portfolio managed through various DeFi strategies to optimize returns and further diversify.

We believe that there are a growing number of users that are seeking the best products, yields and user experiences that belong to a â€˜multi-protocolâ€™ ecosystem. The Layer2DAO is a rare multi-protocol ecosystem initially focused on projects on the following Layer 2 networks initially:

* Arbitrum&#x20;
* Optimism&#x20;
* zkSync&#x20;
* Metis Andromeda&#x20;
* ImmutableX&#x20;
* Loopring&#x20;
* StarkNet
* Boba Network&#x20;
* ZkSwap V2&#x20;
* DeversiFi&#x20;

We look forward to including additional projects and help the Ethereum L2 ecosystem grow.\
