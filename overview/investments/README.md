# ðŸ’° Investments

The L2 ecosystem is ripe for growth. While there has been success building out a competitive marketplace of protocols on the Ethereum mainnet for a financial market to exist, the L2 ecosystem has a lot of room for growth! Protocols today know _how_ to build, but often donâ€™t know _what_ to build. They rely on noisy, biased sources of information: voluntary Discord chats, small-sample directed feedback collection efforts, or plain intuition to chart product roadmaps and deploy development resources.

When establishing relationships with new partner projects and building our investment portfolio, we value:

* Individuals and projects dedicated to the advancement of the Ethereum L2 ecosystem
* Initiatives to improve L2 infrastructure
* Community-driven projects that fill a need identified by the DAO

Here are the criteria we apply when selecting and evaluating projects:

1. Need filled or met by the project
2. Number of users in need or affected by the potential project
3. Complexity of the project and likelihood of success
4. Tokenomics of the project
5. Underlying dev teamâ€™s background and potential ability to deliver
6. Amount of investment it would take to be a meaningful partner
7. Timeline and potential ROI to the treasury
8. Compatible values and vision with Layer2DAO
9. DAOâ€™s community support for the project
10. Opportunity cost and risk mitigation
