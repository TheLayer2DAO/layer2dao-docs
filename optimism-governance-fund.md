# Optimism Governance Fund

Layer2DAO is going to use 240,000 OP tokens to create the OPIncubator project that will incentivise projects that run on Optimism. The first high-impact project that Layer2DAO selected for this initiative was Thales Protocol. In addition to sending Thales 27,500 $OP tokens to provide economics support, the Layer2DAO community has also hosted Thales in the community Discord and will be working on continuing to find ways to help support Thales be successful. We intend to sell this NFT for OP tokens. We are aiming for access to the first round of voting to be economically neutral for a portion of our [Early Adopter](<.gitbook/assets/l2 early adopter nft>) user base. (The NFT launched and has since been used as the mechanism for voting (by holding in a user's wallet, leading to nearly 100% voter participation on Snapshot.)
