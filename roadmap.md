# Roadmap

The first few months since launch have been exciting and we are working hard to continue to build the future of Layer2DAO. Here is the roadmap for growing the DAO for the first 12 months:

* Launch Sushi LP liquidity incentive campaign
* Complete L2DAO airdrop claims by February 28, 2022; unclaimed tokens get returned to treasury
* Further build L2DAO DEX liquidity on Arbitrum
* Launch joint NFT project (L2 Early Adopter NFTs) for L2DAO airdrop recipients with Quixotic on Optimism
* Increase visibility of the project by participating in public events (such as Twitter Spaces)
* Launch .L2 domain offering with Punk Domains
* Partner with projects to create utility for L2 Early Adopter NFTs
* Engage in co-marketing opportunities with partner projects
* Start building the DAO investment portfolio of partner projects, yield generating assets, and stablecoins using modern portfolio theory
* Grow our [Discord](https://discord.gg/layer2dao) community server to become a leading hub for the L2 community and discussions
* Create $L2DAO token utility on other L2s than Arbitrum and enable bridging via Multichain
* Launch incentivized $L2DAO yield farm through Sperax's Demeter Protocol on Arbitrum
* Formalize revenue generation sources for the DAO's sustainability.
* Build significant POL via $L2DAO/$ETH pair on UniswapV3
* Launch $xL2DAO staking to incentive, align and reward long-term stakers of $L2DAO.
* **(ongoing)** Build network of partner projects that can benefit from promotion, liquidity, funding, and operational support
* **(ongoing)** Make strategic investments in partner projects when applicable
* Initiate DAO governance once critical mass of token holders and Discord members has been reached
* Start and facilitate an L2 council, consisting of representatives from the leading L2 networks
* Choose which CEXs to list $L2DAO on.

Through strategic incubation and acceleration, we aim to participate in several projects per year and route a token allocation from these projects directly back into the DAO. On top of receiving token supply, the treasury will also be portfolio managed through various DeFi strategies to optimize returns and further diversify.

We believe that there are a growing number of users that are seeking the best products, yields and user experiences that belong to a ‘multi-protocol’ ecosystem. The Layer2DAO is a rare multi-protocol ecosystem initially focused on projects on the following Layer 2 networks initially:

We look forward to including additional projects and help the Ethereum L2 ecosystem grow.
