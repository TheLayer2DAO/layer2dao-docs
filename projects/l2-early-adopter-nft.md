We're excited to be the launch partner for the new Quixotic NFT Launchpad. Quixotic is an NFT marketplace on both Optimism and Arbitrum, leading the charge to build a thriving NFT ecosystem on layer 2. We couldn't be more excited to partner with them!

There are 9 different NFT levels, each corresponding with the number of L2 networks that early adopters have bridged assets into. The higher the level, the rarer the NFT. There are only 5 level 9 NFTs available to claim.

We calculated the levels using the top ten Layer 2 projects by TVL, as ranked by [https://l2beat.com/](https://l2beat.com/) on January 15, 2022:

We plan on building utility for the NFT with other L2 projects, so hold on to yours tightly. It pays to be an early adopter!
