# .L2 Domain Names

When we first came across [Punk Domains](https://punk.domains/#/partners/l2dao) here at Layer2DAO, we immediately knew we needed to partner with them. Punk Domains not only offers an L2 alternative to ENS, it also vastly expands the concept of on-chain domain names. While ENS does offer “importing” of regular web1 domain names on-chain, the concept is limited to web1 Top Level Domains (TLDs), such as .org and .de. Punk Domains allows setting up web3 native TLDs that live on L2 chains, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Gnosis Chain, but can be used across the entire web3 ecosystem, much like .ETH domains.
