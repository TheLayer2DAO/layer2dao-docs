# Liquidity Incentives

Layer2DAO has [committed](broken-reference) 100,000,000 $L2DAO tokens towards liquidity incentives. These tokens are 10% of total $L2DAO minted.

Beginning at Ethereum block 14187900 liquidity mining incentives began and they will continue until the full 100M are used to incentivize liquidity.

As a recipient of [Optimism Governance funds](https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-layer2dao/1198), we are allocating a portion of our OP tokens as well as additional L2DAO tokens towards building liquidity on Optimism. We launched this liquidity program on July 20, 2022.

\*We reserve the right to adjust this schedule without notice according to market conditions and exchange rates.
