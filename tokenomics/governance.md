# ðŸ“œ Governance

Layer2DAO is supervised by our locked version of the protocols native L2DAO token, xL2DAO. xL2DAO gives DAO and community members the ability to govern and guide the DAO in shaping the Ethereum layer2 ecosystem. The token will eventually allow for active involvement in a distributed voting platform for resource appropriation that carefully distributes project funding and rewards. Members such as marketers and influencers will be chosen and rewarded for building awareness and a strong community behind a multitude of launched projects.

While community governance is critical to the success of a DAO, we aim to find ways to avoid micro-decisions from being bottle-necked by the DAO governance process. This includes investment decisions that might be front-run if voted on publicly. Therefore, we plan on having token holders elect trusted DAO members to various committees that have a mandate and funding approval.



Layer2DAO maintains a verified [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org) Space for conducting DAO governance votes.
