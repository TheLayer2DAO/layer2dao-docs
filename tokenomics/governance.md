# Governance

While community governance is critical to the success of a DAO, we aim to find ways to avoid micro-decisions from being bottle-necked by the DAO governance process. This includes investment decisions that might be front-run if voted on publicly. Therefore, we plan on having token holders elect trusted DAO members to various committees that have a mandate and funding approval.
