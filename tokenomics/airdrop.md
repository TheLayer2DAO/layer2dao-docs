The purpose of the airdrop on Arbitrum is to distribute the Layer2DAO governance tokens ($L2DAO) to early adopters of the top ten Layer 2 projects by TVL, as ranked by [https://l2beat.com/](https://l2beat.com/) on January 15, 2022:

Top 10 Layer 2 Projects by TVL on January 18, 2022

Tokens will be distributed according to the number of projects that the user has bridged assets into. For example, if a user has bridged assets into ImmutableX only, they will receive a 1x token allocation. If they bridged into Arbitrum, Metis, and ImmutableX, they will receive a 3x token allocation. A user has bridged assets into all ten projects, they will receive a 10x token allocation.

In order to document which Ethereum addresses have used specific projects, we look at transactions of each project's bridge contract on Ethereum. While we are aware that there are other ways to move assets into a project (third party bridges, fiat onramps), it would not have been possible for our team to cover all possible methods to bridge assets into the L2 projects. Therefore we are only focusing on each project's official bridge.

These are the bridge contracts that we used in order to validate eligibility for the airdrop:
