# ðŸ’§ Liquidity Incentives

Layer2DAO has [committed](https://docs.layer2dao.org/tokenomics#initial-token-distribution) 100,000,000 $L2DAO tokens towards liquidity incentives. These tokens are 10% of total $L2DAO minted.

### Arbitrum

Beginning at Ethereum block 14187900 liquidity mining incentives began and they will continue until the full 100M are used to incentivize liquidity.

#### **L2DAO/USDs (Arbitrum)**&#x20;

This new Demeter farm pays both L2DAO and SPA rewards. Stake now to ensure you receive max rewards once the rewards launch. \

### Optimism

As a recipient of [Optimism Governance funds](https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-layer2dao/1198), we are allocating a portion of our OP tokens as well as additional L2DAO tokens towards building liquidity on Optimism. We launched this liquidity program on July 20, 2022.&#x20;

#### **L2DAO/OP (Optimism)**&#x20;

This is our new L2DAO liquidity home on Optimism. This farm has a 7 day vesting period. GYSR is a very powerful protocol, and with that the options are a little more complex. We will be providing more detailed instructions on how to provide LP on GYSR shortly. The farm pays rewards in OP tokens (3,000 per week).
