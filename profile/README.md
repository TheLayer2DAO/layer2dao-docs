## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  What is Layer2DAO?

Layer2DAO strives to promote the adoption of the Ethereum L2 ecosystem and enable its members to benefit from its growth. In lieu of some L2 solutions launching their own tokens, Layer2DAO will provide incentives for users to move their funds to L2s and use protocols on those L2s, modeled after other protocols‚Äô successful incentive programs. Layer2DAO also uses its treasury to invest into L2 protocols and ecosystem plays, serving as a diversified venture fund for investors looking to gain exposure to the L2 ecosystem growth.

## üë©‚Äçüíª  The Layer2DAO Value Proposition
Partnerships with other protocols evolve past simple co-marketing and sharing of unsustainable reward emissions, and become circular economic linkages. Protocols extract value from our wide user base (eventually the entire network based on targeted demographics) to improve their product offerings, marketability and brand while Layer2DAO receives either hard assets (sent to the treasury) or continual demand for L2DAO tokens (if protocols choose to pay in L2DAO).
